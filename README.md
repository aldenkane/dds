# DDS: A Two-Feature Underwater Swimmer Detection System

CSE 40535 Term Project by Alden Kane. Uses color and motion detection features from underwater video feed for frame-by-frame swimmer localization and detection.

## Sensor Selection and Data Collection

I used a GoPro Hero7 Black (1920 x 1080 at 30 or 60 FPS) for data collection. I collected approximately 1.5 hours of underwater video at Rolf's Acquatic Center and Rockne Memorial Pool at the University of Notre Dame.


## Directions for Running Program

**Library Requirements, using Python 3.7.5 Release:**

numpy==1.17.4
opencv-contrib-python==4.1.2.30


**Steps for Running Program:**

..1. Clone Repository  
..2. Ensure all libraries are installed  
..3. Set `cam = cv2.VideoCapture('')` location of video to test 
..4. From the top-level directory:  
```
python3 uw_swimmer_detection.py
```


**Test Samples**

..* A test video, at `../dataSet/swim3/swim3.1-12-of-14.mp4` has been provided for running the code


## System Accuracy

Testing by Alden Kane showed an Intersection over Union (IoU) of approximately 0.81 Â± 0.12 on the train and validation sets. The test set, sourced from Rockne Memorial Pool, showed lower classificaiton accuracy due to poor overhead illumination in the pool.

## Parse install on Rasberry Pi

Install npm module in project or root directory
```
npm install parse --save
```

## Execute Write to OptoSwim back4app Image class

Function Arguments:

swimDetected --> Boolean __
numberSwimmers --> Integer__
drownDetected --> Boolean __

Run 
```
node parse.js
```
Image class should show new instance with image file and argument values appended.

## Future Improvements

System improvements can be generated using:  
..* A convolutional neural network (CNN) for swimmer classification. This entails annotating a data set large enough for feature, and then integrating it with color and motion detection in a majority-voting system.  
..* A more diverse data set of swimmers with different skin pigment, age, and swimming style.  
..* Improved sensor selection. Selecting embedded cameras with lower resolution and frame rates can enhance run time, save on computational cost, and allow for scaleable architectures for implementation in commercial pools.
